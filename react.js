//declarative: imperitive programming, series of steps to get to what you want
// declarative implementation detail on how to get it
// in jsx a tag with a capital start gets invoked as a function
// single curlies are read as execute as a javascript, a way to pass objects

//lower tags are HTML svg tags and upper cap tags are treated as components

//in JSX tag with cap is used as function
// props are just pased as component eg, slide was a prop in slideshowcomponents9.js

// state is basically an internally managed config for any component
//components become objects and this.state is a property on the component instance
//this.setState implemented in react component which has to be extended
